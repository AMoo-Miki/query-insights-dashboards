# OpenSearch Query Insights Dashboards

## Introduction
This is a OpenSearch-Dashboard plugin for Query Insights.

OpenSearch stands as a versatile, scalable, open-source solution designed for diverse data exploration needs, ranging from interactive log analytics to real-time application monitoring. Despite its capabilities, OpenSearch users and administrators often encounter challenges in ensuring optimal search performance due to limited expertise or OpenSearch's current constraints in providing comprehensive data points on query executions. Common questions include:

* “What are the top queries with highest latency/CPU usages in the last 1 hour” (Identification of top queries by certain resource usages within a specific timeframe).
* “How do I associate queries to users” (Profiling users with the highest search query volumes).
* “Why my search queries are so slow” (Concerns about slow search queries).
* “Why there was a spike in my search latency chart” (Spikes in query latency).

The overarching objective of the Query Insights initiative is to address these issues by building frameworks, APIs, and dashboards, with minimal performance impact, to offer profound insights, metrics and recommendations into query executions, empowering users to better understand search query characteristics, patterns, and system behavior during query execution stages. Query Insights will facilitate enhanced detection, diagnosis, and prevention of query performance issues, ultimately improving query processing performance, user experience, and overall system resilience.

Query Insights and this dashboard plugin project was originally proposed in the [OpenSearch Query Insights RFC](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/11429) and [OpenSearch Query Insights Dashboards RFC](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/issues/5571)
